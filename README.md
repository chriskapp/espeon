# espeon

With espeon you can generate templates based on mysql database structures. It 
uses FreeMarker as template engine so you can use it to generate i.e. 
source-code

## Installation

First you have to enter the mysql credentials in the espeon.conf.xml. There must
be an templates and output folder. For each file in the template folder it will
generate an file in the output folder (for each selected table). It has an 
simple GUI but can also be used over CLI.
